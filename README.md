# student-pagination-app

An app built with vanilla JavaScript for my TeamTreehouse Techdegree end of Unit 2 challenge project.

## What does it do?

Provides a list of many students with some info for each student. The list of students is rendered on the page in a styled card format using just vanilla Javascript. 

Each page renders only up to 9 students with the pagination options at the bottom of the page. 

There is also a feature to search the student database to filter out any students not matching what is entered in the search field.

## Languages & Frameworks

Built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
